    "#### Problem 1 - Word Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to implement some code that allows us to calculate the score for a single word. The function getWordScore should accept as input a string of lowercase letters (a word) and return the integer score for that word, using the game's scoring rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>A Reminder of the Scoring Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring</b>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>The score for the hand is the sum of the scores for each word formed.</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the word, multiplied by the length of the word, plus 50 points if all n letters are used on the first word created.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>For example, 'weed' would be worth 32 points ((4+1+1+2) for the four letters, then multiply by len('weed') to get (4+1+1+2)*4 = 32). Be sure to check that the hand actually has 1 'w', 2 'e's, and 1 'd' before scoring the word!</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>As another example, if n=7 and you make the word 'waybill' on the first try, it would be worth 155 points (the base score for 'waybill' is (4+1+4+3+1+1+1)*7=105, plus an additional 50 point bonus for using all n letters).</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### <b>Hints</b>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>You may assume that the input word is always either a string of lowercase letters, or the empty string \"\".</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>You will want to use the SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES dictionary defined at the top of ps4a.py. You should not change its value.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Do not assume that there are always 7 letters in a hand! The parameter n is the number of letters required for a bonus score (the maximum number of letters in the hand). Our goal is to keep the code modular - if you want to try playing your word game with n=10 or n=4, you will be able to do it by simply changing the value of HAND_SIZE!</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Testing: If this function is implemented properly, and you run test_ps4a.py, you should see that the test_getWordScore() tests pass. Also test your implementation of getWordScore, using some reasonable English words.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the code for getWordScore in ps4a.py and be sure you've passed the appropriate tests in test_ps4a.py before pasting your function definition here.\n",
