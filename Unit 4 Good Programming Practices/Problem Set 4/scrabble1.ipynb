    "The first step is to implement some code that allows us to calculate the score for a single word. The function getWordScore should accept as input a string of lowercase letters (a word) and return the integer score for that word, using the game's scoring rules.\n",

    "<b>A Reminder of the Scoring Rules\n",

    "Scoring</b>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>The score for the hand is the sum of the scores for each word formed.</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the word, multiplied by the length of the word, plus 50 points if all n letters are used on the first word created.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>For example, 'weed' would be worth 32 points ((4+1+1+2) for the four letters, then multiply by len('weed') to get (4+1+1+2)*4 = 32). Be sure to check that the hand actually has 1 'w', 2 'e's, and 1 'd' before scoring the word!</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>As another example, if n=7 and you make the word 'waybill' on the first try, it would be worth 155 points (the base score for 'waybill' is (4+1+4+3+1+1+1)*7=105, plus an additional 50 point bonus for using all n letters).</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "<li>Do not assume that there are always 7 letters in a hand! The parameter n is the number of letters required for a bonus score (the maximum number of letters in the hand). Our goal is to keep the code modular - if you want to try playing your word game with n=10 or n=4, you will be able to do it by simply changing the value of HAND_SIZE!</li>\n",

    "#### Problem 2 - Dealing with Hands\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please read this problem entirely!!** The majority of this problem consists of learning how to read code, which is an incredibly useful and important skill. At the end, you will implement a short function. Be sure to take your time on this problem - it may seem easy, but reading someone else's code can be challenging and this is an important exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>Representing hands</b>\n",
    "A <b>hand</b> is the set of letters held by a player during the game. The player is initially dealt a set of random letters. For example, the player could start out with the following hand: <b>a, q, l, m, u, i, l</b> . In our program, a hand will be represented as a dictionary: the keys are (lowercase) letters and the values are the number of times the particular letter is repeated in that hand. For example, the above hand would be represented as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Notice how the repeated letter 'l' is represented. Remember that with a dictionary, the usual way to access a value is hand['a'], where 'a' is the key we want to find. However, this only works if the key is in the dictionary; otherwise, we get a KeyError. To avoid this, we can use the call hand.get('a',0). This is the \"safe\" way to access a value if we are not sure the key is in the dictionary. d.get(key,default) returns the value for key if key is in the dictionary d, else default. If default is not given, it returns None, so that this method never raises a KeyError. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> hand['e']\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "KeyError: 'e'\n",
    ">>> hand.get('e', 0)\n",
    "0\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### <b>Converting words into dictionary representation</b>\n",
    "One useful function we've defined for you is getFrequencyDict, defined near the top of ps4a.py. When given a string of letters as an input, it returns a dictionary where the keys are letters and the values are the number of times that letter is represented in the input string. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> getFrequencyDict(\"hello\")\n",
    "{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, this is the same kind of dictionary we use to represent hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>Displaying a hand</b>\n",
    "Given a hand represented as a dictionary, we want to display it in a user-friendly way. We have provided the implementation for this in the displayHand function. Take a few minutes right now to read through this function carefully and understand what it does and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>Generating a random hand</b>\n",
    "The hand a player is dealt is a set of letters chosen at random. We provide you with the implementation of a function that generates this random hand, dealHand. The function takes as input a positive integer n, and returns a new object, a hand containing n lowercase letters. Again, take a few minutes (right now!) to read through this function carefully and understand what it does and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>Removing letters from a hand (you implement this)</b>\n",
    "The player starts with a hand, a set of letters. As the player spells out words, letters from this set are used up. For example, the player could start out with the following hand: <b>a, q, l, m, u, i, l</b> . The player could choose to spell the word <b>quail</b> . This would leave the following letters in the player's hand: <b>l, m</b>. Your task is to implement the function updateHand, which takes in two inputs - a hand and a word (string). updateHand uses letters from the hand to spell the word, and then returns a copy of the hand, containing only the letters remaining. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}\n",
    ">>> displayHand(hand) # Implemented for you\n",
    "a q l l m u i\n",
    ">>> hand = updateHand(hand, 'quail') # You implement this function!\n",
    ">>> hand\n",
    "{'a':0, 'q':0, 'l':1, 'm':1, 'u':0, 'i':0}\n",
    ">>> displayHand(hand)\n",
    "l m\n",
    "```\n",
    "Implement the updateHand function. Make sure this function has no side effects: i.e., it must not mutate the hand passed in. Before pasting your function definition here, be sure you've passed the appropriate tests in test_ps4a.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hints\n",
    "<b>Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing:</b> Make sure the test_updateHand() tests pass. You will also want to test your implementation of updateHand with some reasonable inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Copying Dictionaries</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wish to review the \".copy\" method of Python dictionaries (review this and other Python dictionary methods here).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your implementation of updateHand should be short (ours is 4 lines of code). It does not need to call any helper functions."
