    "<li>Start with $10 payments per month and calculate whether the balance will be paid off in a year this way (be sure to take into account the interest accrued each month).</li><br>\n",

    "##### <b>Hint: A way of structuring your code</b>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>If you are struggling with how to structure your code, think about the following:</li>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Given an initial balance, what code would compute the balance at the end of the year?</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Now imagine that we try our initial balance with a monthly payment of $10. If there is a balance remaining at the end of the year, how could we write code that would reset the balance to the initial balance, increase the payment by $10, and try again (using the same code!) to compute the balance at the end of the year, to see if this new payment value is large enough.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<li><b>I'm still confused!</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to implement this problem will be to use a loop structure. You may want to refresh your understanding of while loops. Think hard about how the program will know when it has found a good minimum monthly payment value - when a good value is found, the loop can terminate.</li>\n",
